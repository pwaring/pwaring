### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance PHP developer and Linux system administrator based in Manchester, UK.

The majority of my repositories are small projects which I work on to solve problems
that I've experienced, but you are welcome to use them, subject to the relevant
LICENSE.

If you'd like to hire me to write code or manage systems, I can be found at: [phpdev.uk](https://www.phpdev.uk)
